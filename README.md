62410 CDIO-Project 24
This project aims to win the tournament to become the partner of the company that needs a GolfBot.

Task
The task we were given is to build an EV3 robot that is able to navigate a game field and catch ping pong balls. While doing so, it has to stay away from the walls of the field and not move the flamingo egg. To win this game, points are awarded or deducted for each ball you pick up and for every centimeter you move the flamingo egg. Below is the point system.

Point System
100 points** per ball that exits the field through Goal B.
150 points** per ball that exits the field through Goal A.
200 points** for delivering the orange ball first.
3 points** for every remaining second when the balls are delivered.
-50 points** if the robot touches the field boundaries or obstacles.
-100 points** if the robot moves an obstacle or boundary by more than 1 cm.
-300 points** for moving the flamingo egg by more than 1 cm.
Project Overview
Our goal is to design, build, and program an autonomous EV3 robot capable of collecting as many ping pong balls as possible within a defined area, without disrupting the setup of the field. The field is approximately 180 x 120 cm with a known obstacle and a flamingo egg that the robot must avoid moving. The robot should be fully autonomous once started and should complete the task within 8 minutes.
